to do / fix:
- add light to hut
- remove hut window - make open doorframe
- add wall/fence next to garage to obstruct vision into CT-Spawn from A
- make all connector windows slightly taller to make crawling through faster
- fix cheeky peek around hut
- block off dark corners/caves in Mid-B crate walls
- clip off enterance into Mid minivan
- add jump up to A site from T-Side of site (put as far away from suicide as possible)
- fix vents enterance at B site
- fix vents latter at B site
- add clippings for bathrooms' roof
- remove walkway next to hut
- fix porta potty doors at A site (wait til V1.2)

potential ideas / general suggestions:
- make mid narrower (would allow for more effective smoking off)
- lessen number of hiding spots at A-site
- make it easier for CTs to hold suicide
- add cover for Mid->B enterance for retakes
- make second mid more powerful? or is that unneccessary since it already gives full T-Side A control?
